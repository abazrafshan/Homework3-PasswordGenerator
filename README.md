# PasswordGenerator

## Repository

This repository is where I develop the password generator application. The source code is available to the public.

## Description

The importance of cyber security is only increasing as the amount of content and information available online continues to expand. That being the case, the use of complicated, hard-to-guess passwords are also growing in importance. This application is a robust password generator that can enhance the user's cyber security by generating a password of random characters based on input from the user. Characteristics that the user will be asked to confirm in the generated password are length of the password (must be between 8 and 128 units) and whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols. 

Building this project was an excellent introduction to deploying functions and accompanying logic in Javascript to munipulate an HTML file to present the user with the password generator. 

## Credits

This program was created with debugging feedback from class instructor Bryan and class TA Wilson. 

Enjoy!
